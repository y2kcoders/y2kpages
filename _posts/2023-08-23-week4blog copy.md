# test link

https://y2kcoders.github.io/skatepark.co/test

this is just to test dom update potential before a real commit


# potential things to add

- add cooldown so people can't spam the button
- add star rating with update so star rating can be updated
- create a function that lets a user edit the items in the database through the frontend? (I think this needs more thought)
