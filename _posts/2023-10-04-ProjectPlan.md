description: The plan is to show java learning by making a rating website
---

## Background
We wanted to make something useful for people to use. But would still bring a some hardship to creating the project. So with this in mind we decided to have a team meeting and brainstorm ideas.

### Brainstorm
- Creating a multiplayer game
- **Review site similar to things like yelp, imdb, etc..**
- A site for improvement of health and fitness

## Why
The it came down to three main things as to why we ended up choosing a review site, specifically about skateparks
- There were some challenges coming up with some features that nobody in our group had made
- A majority in our group agreed upon this idea
- I came up with the idea so I chose what we would review, skateboarding

## Four things we want to make
- Chatboard
- Comments
- Posts
- Google Maps API


## Assignment of tasks

### Frontend: Mati
- I deiced to work on frontend because with my previous work using SASS and CSS, I would like to think I am the most qualified
- I also had a lot of ideas for wireframes for the features we were discussing

### Scrum Master: Finn
- In the 3 previous groups I was in I had the role of Scrum Masters 2 times
- Since I also created the idea of skatepark reviewing website, I thought it would be fit for me to lead the team

### Backend: Justin
- While talking about the backend implantation of our project I realized that I would be better fit for this role
- I also have a better understanding of the backend

### Dev Ops: James
- Similar to Finn, I have also been the Dev Ops in most of my groups
- I also have a better understanding of backend and connection between frontend and backend

## Assets/Ideas

- Mati: Use dinky theme
- Finn: I have a really some really cool css for input boxes to use
